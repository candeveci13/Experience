PuTTY
    PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. 
    It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection. 
    It can also connect to a serial port. The name "PuTTY" has no official meaning.

telnet
    One of the greatest disadvantages of this protocol is that all data, including usernames and passwords, 
    is sent in clear text, which is a potential security risk.
    This is the main reason why Telnet is rarely used today and is being replaced by a much secure protocol called SSH

ssh
    SSH is a network protocol used to remotely access and manage a device. The key difference between Telnet and SSH is 
    that SSH uses encryption, which means that all data transmitted over a network is secure from eavesdropping. SSH uses 
    the public key encryption for such purposes.
