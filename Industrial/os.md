PuTTY
PuTTY is a free and open-source terminal emulator, serial console and network file transfer application. 
It supports several network protocols, including SCP, SSH, Telnet, rlogin, and raw socket connection. 
It can also connect to a serial port. The name "PuTTY" has no official meaning.

telnet
One of the greatest disadvantages of this protocol is that all data, including usernames and passwords, 
is sent in clear text, which is a potential security risk.
This is the main reason why Telnet is rarely used today and is being replaced by a much secure protocol called SSH
```

```
ssh
SSH is a network protocol used to remotely access and manage a device. The key difference between Telnet and SSH is 
that SSH uses encryption, which means that all data transmitted over a network is secure from eavesdropping. SSH uses 
the public key encryption for such purposes.

Microsoft Hyper-V
Originally codenamed Viridian, and then Windows Server Virtualization, it was rebranded to Hyper-V Server when it was first released in late 2008.
These days it comes as part of Windows 10 Pro and Windows Server (2012 and 2016), at no additional cost to the user.
However, what you get for nothing is a very basic hypervisor that can’t do the clever things that VMware offers.
The guest OS support includes Windows Server, Windows XP SP3 or later, Linux with a 3.4 or better Kernel and FreeBSD. Although driver support 
for Linux isn’t great, and there is no virtual GPU support.
Hyper-V allows relatively inexperienced users to create a virtual server environment, but don’t expect miracles.
