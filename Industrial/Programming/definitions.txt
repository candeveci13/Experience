Lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed.
It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used.
The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading.
The performance gains are especially significant if the initialization of the object is costly, such as in case of accessing network services.
This makes it ideal in use cases where network content is accessed and initialization times are to be kept at a minimum, such as in the case of web pages.


The Golden Rule of Programming
For years I have had a saying that I say to my team all the time. I call it the golden rule of programming.  I think every new programmer needs a tattoo that says it.
“If it can be null, it will be null” The good news is that a lot of null reference errors can be avoided by adding additional logic and code to ensure objects are not 
null before trying to use them. Developers should always assume that everything is invalid and be very defensive in their code. 
Pretend every database call is going to fail, every field is going to have messed up data in it. Good exception handling best practices are critical.
