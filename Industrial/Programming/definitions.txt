Lazy loading is a design pattern commonly used in computer programming to defer initialization of an object until the point at which it is needed.
It can contribute to efficiency in the program's operation if properly and appropriately used.
The opposite of lazy loading is eager loading.
The performance gains are especially significant if the initialization of the object is costly, such as in case of accessing network services.
This makes it ideal in use cases where network content is accessed and initialization times are to be kept at a minimum, such as in the case of web pages.
