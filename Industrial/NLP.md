# Natural Langugage Processing

```
TOPICS 

Topics of the 22nd conference will include (but are not limited to): 

Speech Recognition (multilingual, continuous, emotional speech, 
handicapped speaker, out-of-vocabulary words, alternative way of 
feature extraction, new models for acoustic and language modeling). 

Corpora and Language Resources (monolingual, multilingual, text, and 
spoken corpora, large web corpora, disambiguation, specialized 
lexicons, dictionaries). 

Speech and Spoken Language Generation (multilingual, high fidelity 
speech synthesis, computer singing). 

Tagging, Classification and Parsing of Text and Speech (multilingual 
processing, sentiment analysis, credibility analysis, automatic text 
labeling, summarization, authorship attribution). 

Semantic Processing of Text and Speech (information extraction, 
information retrieval, data mining, semantic web, knowledge 
representation, inference, ontologies, sense disambiguation, plagiarism 
detection). 

Integrating Applications of Text and Speech Processing (machine 
translation, natural language understanding, question-answering 
strategies, assistive technologies). 

Automatic Dialogue Systems (self-learning, multilingual, 
question-answering systems, dialogue strategies, prosody in dialogues). 

Multimodal Techniques and Modeling (video processing, facial animation, 
visual speech synthesis, user modeling, emotion and personality 
modeling).

FlashText: a Python library created specifically for the purpose of searching and replacing words in a document. Now, the way FlashText works is that it requires a word or a list of words and a string. The words which FlashText calls keywords are then searched or replaced in the string.

textacy is a Python library for performing a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, built on the high-performance spaCy library. With the fundamentals --- tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing, etc. --- delegated to another library, textacy focuses primarily on the tasks that come before and follow after.

Glove: is an unsupervised learning algorithm for generating vector representations for words.
Training is done using a co-occcurence matrix from a corpus. The resulting representations contain structure useful for many other tasks.
The paper describing the model is [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/glove.pdf).

Discourse/Text Structure Recognition
```

```
Automatic summarization produces an understandable summary of a set of text and provides summaries or detailed information
of text of a known type. 
```

```
Co-reference resolution: it refers to a sentence or larger set of text that determines which word refer to the same object.
```

```
Discourse analysis refers to the task of identifying the discourse structure of connected text.
```

```
Machine translation which refers to automatic translation of text from one human language to another.
```

```
Morphological segmentation which refers to separate word into individual morphemes and identify the class of  the  morphemes. 
```

```
Named entity recognition (NER) it describes a stream of text, determine which items in the text relates to proper names. 
```

```
Part of speech tagging it describes a sentence, determines the part of speech for each word.
