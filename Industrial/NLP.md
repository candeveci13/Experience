TOPICS 

Topics of the 22nd conference will include (but are not limited to): 

Speech Recognition (multilingual, continuous, emotional speech, 
handicapped speaker, out-of-vocabulary words, alternative way of 
feature extraction, new models for acoustic and language modeling). 

Corpora and Language Resources (monolingual, multilingual, text, and 
spoken corpora, large web corpora, disambiguation, specialized 
lexicons, dictionaries). 

Speech and Spoken Language Generation (multilingual, high fidelity 
speech synthesis, computer singing). 

Tagging, Classification and Parsing of Text and Speech (multilingual 
processing, sentiment analysis, credibility analysis, automatic text 
labeling, summarization, authorship attribution). 

Semantic Processing of Text and Speech (information extraction, 
information retrieval, data mining, semantic web, knowledge 
representation, inference, ontologies, sense disambiguation, plagiarism 
detection). 

Integrating Applications of Text and Speech Processing (machine 
translation, natural language understanding, question-answering 
strategies, assistive technologies). 

Automatic Dialogue Systems (self-learning, multilingual, 
question-answering systems, dialogue strategies, prosody in dialogues). 

Multimodal Techniques and Modeling (video processing, facial animation, 
visual speech synthesis, user modeling, emotion and personality 
modeling).
